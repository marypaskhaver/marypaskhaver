### Hello! I'm Mary.

I'm a freshman at Rutgers with published iOS apps and experience in web development, and I'm fascinated with synthesizing tech and the humanities to promote positive change.

I'm currently studying React Native, writing short stories, and dreaming up new mobile app ideas. 

Want to collaborate on anything iOS or web related? Contact me at mary.paskhaver@gmail.com.
