### Hello! I'm Mary.

I'm a sophomore at Rutgers with three published apps and experience in web development.

I'm currently studying React Native, writing short stories, and dreaming up new mobile app ideas.

My apps:<br>
- "Rutgers RUMobile" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rutgers-rumobile/id1036544263) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rumobile&gl=US).
- "Sokoban: The Journey" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sokoban-the-journey/id1572505145).
- "Deedy - Make an Impact" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deedy-make-an-impact/id1523913427).<br>
