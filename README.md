### Hello! I'm Mary.

I'm a sophomore at Rutgers with three published apps and experience in web development, and I'm fascinated with synthesizing tech and the humanities to promote positive change.

I'm currently studying React Native, writing short stories, and dreaming up new mobile app ideas.

My apps:<br>
- "Rutgers RUMobile" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rutgers-rumobile/id1036544263) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rumobile&gl=US).
- "Sokoban: The Journey" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/sokoban-the-journey/id1572505145).
- "Deedy - Make an Impact" [for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/deedy-make-an-impact/id1523913427).
