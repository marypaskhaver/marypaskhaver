### Hello! I'm Mary.

I'm a freshman at Rutgers with published iOS apps and experience in web development, and I'm fascinated with synthesizing tech and the humanities to promote positive change.

I'm currently studying object-oriented programming and unit testing with Sandi Metz's _99 Bottles of OOP_, writing short stories, and dreaming up new mobile app ideas. 

Want to collaborate on anything iOS or web related? Contact me at mary.paskhaver@gmail.com.
